# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

#Debouncing:

typing slow = the difference between the key stroke is 200ms
typing fast = the difference between the key stroke is 30ms

It is useless to call api for every key storke 
now lets look at the performance 

performance: 
     - iphone pro max = 14 letters  -> for 14 letters * 1000 = 14000 calls
     -if suppose thousands of people are making API calls it will be making 14000 API calls 
     - with Debouncing  = 3 API calls * 1000 = 3000 API calls

Debouncing with 200ms 
   - (<200ms) when debouncing is applied with 200 ms it means that diff between 2 key strokes is <200ms - then should decline the API call  
   -  (>200ms) make an API call


Suppose if we want to search iphone and we have written setTImeout to call the api after every three seconds. 

If we type one word i in 3s -> api call is made after 3 seconds with i
if we type i with phone within 3 sec -> api call is made with iphone in 3 sec now this declines all other calls with ip,iph, ipho, iphon. This process is debouncing
